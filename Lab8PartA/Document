Document: Lazy Loading and @Transactional in Spring

By adding @Transactional on the service layer, it makes that Hibernate session is available during the execution of servie methods, allowing lazy loading to function correctly.
That's why we don't need eager loading anymore as entities are loaded on demand within the transactional context.

However, without @Transactional, Hibernate session is closed before the lazy-loaded entities are accessed. That's why at that time eager loading is needed.
